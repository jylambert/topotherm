# topotherm

topotherm is a pyomo-based open-source optimization model for
district heating network design.

## Intro

Topotherm is a pyomo-based mixed-integer linear programming district heating
network design model which scales well into larger districts for single
and mulitple time steps.
It has been benchmarked against multiple other open-source models in a
publication available at:

## Feature overview

* Single time-step topology and piping optimization.
  * Multiple time-steps version additionally includes operation with variable
  heating demands.
  * Greenfield optimization
  * Existing network in development.
* Forced and economic expansion of the district heating network to consumers.
* Supports all solvers of pyomo, but the output helper functions in utils.py
might have to be rewritten (utils.py)
* Plotting functions included

## Description

To run the model, several incidence matrices have to be formulated. Then, the linear regression
parameters can be calculated for a given supply, ambient and return temperature of the network.
A pyomo model is then set up and solved with the solver of your choice.

## Why should I use this?

Topotherm has the best scaling properties of multiple open-source models and
has been benchmarked and validated.

## Getting Started

This repository needs a PC capable to run python and its standard libraries.

### Requirements

* Anaconda, mamba or venv

## Install

Use git to clone this repository into your computer. Then, install topotherm
with a package manager such as Anaconda, or directly with Python.

```git
git clone https://github.com/jylambert/topotherm.git
```

### Python

```Python
cd topotherm
pip install .
```

This can also be done with venv or equivalent.

### Anaconda or mamba

We recommend to install the dependencies with anaconda or mamba:

```mamba
cd topotherm
mamba env create -f environment.yml -n topotherm
mamba activate topotherm
```

## Solver

### Gurobi

The results in the paper were obtained with the commercial solver gurobi.
A free academic license is available and can be installed by following
the documentation [here](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-).

### Open-source Alternatives

You can try the code on smaller benchmarks with several open source solvers,
such as SCIP. Other popular open-source options are COIN-OR's cbc or HiGHS.

```mamba
mamba activate topotherm
mamba install -c conda-forge pyscipopt
```

## Usage

Generate the input incidence matrices for the district with .parquet format (see example).
Then, modify and run the either one of the three scripts in that folder.

```bash
cd example
python run_sts.py
```

## Contribute

Pull requests and any feedback regarding the code are very welcome. For major
changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Tests

To run the tests, use pytest.

```Python
pip install .[dev]
pytest tests
```

## Docs

Activate the topotherm environment:

```conda activate topotherm```

Then, install the optional requirements:

```pip install .[docs]```

In the topotherm root directory run:

```sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/ .```

Then make the hmtl documentation files: ::

```
cd docs
make html
```

The documentation is located under docs/build/html.
